<!-- Here are **10 Python practice questions** to help you sharpen your skills — you can pick and choose based on your level. (These are inspired by the many exercise collections available online. ([geeksforgeeks.org][1]))

1. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
2. Given a string, write a program to determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
3. Write a function that receives a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.
4. Given a dictionary where keys are strings and values are ints, write a program that swaps them so values become keys and keys become values (assuming all values are unique).
5. Write a class `Rectangle` with attributes `width` and `height`, a method to compute area, and a method to compute perimeter. Then create an instance and print area & perimeter.
6. Given a text file, write a program that reads the file, counts how many times each word appears, and writes the results to a new file sorted by frequency.
7. Given two lists of integers, write a program that returns a list of all integers that appear in both lists (i.e., intersection) without duplicates, sorted.
8. Write a function that takes a string of words, and returns the word which has the maximum length. If multiple have the same maximum length, return the first one.
9. Using list comprehension (or equivalent), write code that given a list of numbers, produces a list of the squares of the numbers that are divisible by 3.
10. Write a program that takes a list of integers and “compresses” consecutive duplicates into tuples: e.g., input `[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3]` → output `[(1,3),(2,2),(3,4)]` where each tuple is (value, count). -->

If you tell me your **current level** (beginner / intermediate / advanced) I can **customise another set of questions** for you (with increasing difficulty) — would you like that?
